#### A 3-Part Study Across Iowa & Massachusetts

{: data-content="hr with text"}
### Overview:

This project explored how rural residents perceive and trust autonomous vehicles (AVs). Across three studies—pre/post surveys, a large-scale online survey, and in-depth interviews—I analyzed how tech attitudes, mobility needs, and personal values shape trust, perceived usefulness, and intention to use AVs.

### Problem:

Rural areas are often overlooked in AV design and deployment. We wanted to understand what drives or blocks AV acceptance in these communities and how to design systems that people trust and want to use.

### Users:

- **Primary:** Rural residents in low-density, car-dependent areas
- **Secondary:** AV designers, HMI teams, policy makers, and mobility planners

### My Role:

I led data analysis across all three phases:
- Cleaned and analyzed survey data (R, Jamovi)
- Ran statistical modeling (Type III ANOVA, FAMD)
- Conducted and coded interviews (NVivo)
- Created personas and synthesized stakeholder insights

### Project Scope:

- Timeline: 6 months
- 3 studies: Pre/Post ride study in Iowa, online survey in Massachusetts, interviews across both states
- Constraints: Small sample sizes, varied rural definitions, recruitment limitations

### Process (3-Phase Breakdown):

1. **Pre/Post AV Ride Study – Iowa** <br>
    **Goal:** See if riding an AV changes user perceptions <br>
    **Method:** <br>
        - Collected pre/post surveys after AV shuttle ride
        - Ran FAMD + Type III ANOVA
    **Key Finding:** Ride exposure alone didn’t build trust—tech attitudes mattered more
2. **AV Acceptance Survey – Massachusetts** <br>
    **Goal:** Understand predictors of AV acceptance <br>
    **Method:**<br>
        - Distributed surveys (in-person and online)
        - Used TAM, trust, privacy scales
        - Clustered respondents into personas
    **Key Finding:** Mindset and mobility history drove trust more than age or income
3. **AInterviews with Residents & Stakeholders** <br>
    **Goal:** Capture qualitative insights on trust and HMI needs <br>
    **Method:**<br>
        - 1:1 video interviews using AV visuals as prompts
        - Thematic analysis to identify expectations and concerns
    **Key Finding:** People want simple, clear HMI cues—especially for AV decisions

### Outcomes:
- Identified gaps in multimodal HMIs (most focus on visual-only systems)
- Highlighted where humans remain essential in L4 trucking (e.g., inspections, legal fallback)
- Proposed interface features to improve explainability and situational awareness
- Provided design takeaways that will guide our next simulation-based HMI prototypes

### Tools & Frameworks:

- Coactive Design (for human-automation task mapping)
- CDL Task Extraction (for grounding user roles)
- Matrix Visualization (to spot HMI gaps)
- Literature Scoping (to map state of the field)

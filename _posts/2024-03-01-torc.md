title: 'Operational Transparency & UX Strategy for Autonomous Trucking'
---
#### UX Research Internship at TORC Robotics

{: data-content="hr with text"}
### Overview:

At TORC Robotics, I led cross-functional UX research to improve data transparency, internal tooling, and communication in autonomous truck testing. My work focused on how teams across engineering, safety, and product shared operational data—and how design could support safer, more scalable deployment.

### Problem:

As testing scaled across closed-course and public roads, internal teams struggled with siloed data, unclear workflows, and inconsistent documentation. My challenge:
- Identify transparency pain points
- Improve collaboration across roles
- Propose UX solutions for high-impact workflow issues

### Users & Audience:

- **Primary:** Internal teams (test operators, safety drivers, data ops, engineers, PMs)
- **Stakeholders:** AV platform teams, simulation tools owners, safety/ops managers

### My Role:

As a UX Research Intern, I:
- Conducted 32 interviews across roles and time zones
- Mapped data journeys from vehicle logs to team dashboards
- Delivered 5+ workflow improvement proposals
- Collaborated on MVP route design for Texas deployments
- Proposed scalable UX research strategies using test data

### Constraints:

- Complex, technical workflows with minimal documentation
- Time zone and scheduling challenges across cross-functional teams
- Fast-moving product cycles requiring lean, high-impact insights

### Process Highlights:

1. **Led 32 Cross-Team Interviews** <br>
    - Semi-structured interviews with field testers, devs, safety leads, and PMs
    - Surfaced mismatched data expectations, unclear ownership, and tool confusion
    - Learned: Every team had its own “source of truth”—a transparency challenge

2. **Mapped the Data Journey** <br>
    - Visualized how testing data moves: from in-vehicle logging → triage tools → team dashboards
    - Identified invisible gaps and misaligned handoffs
    - Delivered journey maps that helped align team mental models

3. **Interviews with Residents & Stakeholders** <br>
    - Standardized test metadata across teams
    - Improved dashboard visibility and data handoff flow
    - Introduced UX checkpoints into tooling
    - Result: Reduced miscommunication and faster test feedback loops
 
4. **Contributed to MVP Route Planning in Texas** <br>
    - Collaborated with safety, mapping, and ops teams
    - Evaluated routes based on infrastructure, human factors, and legal constraints
    - Learned: AV UX isn’t just about interfaces—it’s about designing operational ecosystems

5. **Designed Scalable UX Metrics Strategy** <br>
    - Proposed linking UX research to test log data (e.g., friction events, labeling delays)
    - Moved toward embedded, continuous UX measurement in tooling
    - Sparked early adoption conversations for UX analytics dashboards

6. **Delivered Stakeholder-Centric Reports** <br>
    - Created visuals, flow maps, and friction summaries for each audience
    - Ensured UX insights connected to business and safety KPIs
    - Result: Insights were adopted in Q3 planning and sprint priorities

### Key Learnings:
- UX in autonomy = systemic thinking across tools, roles, and road environments
- Even small clarity improvements (shared metadata, journey maps) have huge downstream effects
- Translating UX into safety, efficiency, and deployment terms builds credibility in technical teams

### Impact:

- Multiple cross-functional teams adopted my transparency recommendations
- Work helped inform MVP route selection and simulation tooling priorities
- Sparked new initiatives for UX-data integration at TORC

### Reflection: 

“This experience taught me how to bring UX strategy into deeply technical, high-stakes environments—and why operational transparency is foundational to scalable AV systems.”

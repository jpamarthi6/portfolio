title: 'Risk-ATTEND: Helping Teen Drivers Anticipate Road Hazards'
---
#### A Simulator-Backed Training Program Funded by Toyota CSRC

### Overview:

Toyota’s Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC) funded this project to address teen driver safety. We designed Risk-ATTEND, a hazard anticipation training tool that combines scenario-based web instruction and simulator testing to help new drivers detect road risks earlier and more effectively.

### Problem:

Teen drivers are overrepresented in crashes, especially in situations that require hazard anticipation. Traditional training methods often lack realism and interactivity. We asked:
- Can a short training improve teens' ability to detect road hazards?
- What makes training engaging, effective, and easy for young drivers?

### Users:

- **Primary:** Newly licensed teens (ages 16–18)
- **Secondary:** Toyota CSRC, automotive safety researchers, HMI/UX designers

### My Role:

I led the project from start to finish:
- Designed and prototyped the training
- Ran pilot and large-scale studies
- Recruited and tested 53 teens
- Analyzed behavioral and workload data
- Mentored 7 student researchers

### Constraints:

- Difficult in-person recruitment
- IRB and parental consent challenges
- Limited simulator access
- Pilot had <10 participants, requiring careful interpretation

### Process Highlights:

1. **Prototyped Training in Axure RP** <br>
    - Designed scenario-based, interactive learning
    - Balanced realism with simplicity for teen comprehension

2. **Ran Pilot Usability Study (n < 10)** <br>
    - Identified pain points: language complexity, visual timing
    - Refined layout and scenario structure based on teen feedback

3. **AInterviews with Residents & Stakeholders** <br>
    - Added diverse hazards and simplified UI
    - Increased scenario clarity and realism
 
4. **Built Realistic Simulator Scenarios** <br>
    - Programmed events to mirror training content
    - Captured brake latency, glance behavior, and reaction times

5. **Recruited & Trained 53 Teen Drivers** <br>
    - In-person recruitment across schools and communities
    - Collected eye-tracking and simulator performance data

6. **Analyzed Data** <br>
    - Used ANOVA and t-tests to compare pre/post outcomes
    - Measured NASA-TLX workload scores
    - Found significant gains in hazard anticipation and reduced cognitive load

7. **Mentored Research Team** <br>
    - Taught undergrads to annotate video data
    - Built scalable workflows for high-quality analysis

### Key Findings:
- Teens trained with Risk-ATTEND responded faster to hazards
- Reported less cognitive workload post-training
- Iterative design improved both comprehension and performance
- Scalable mentorship supported deep analysis and team growth

### Reflection: 

“This was first research project I led. If I were to do it again, I’d add a follow-up phase to measure real-world driving impact and automated the data analysis process more.”

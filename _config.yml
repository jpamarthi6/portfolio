  In Summer 2024, I worked as a UX Research Intern at <a href="https://torc.ai/" target="_blank">TORC Robotics</a>, leading stakeholder research, uncovering transparency 
  gaps, and optimizing UX workflows for AV development. My work led to five key process improvements, streamlining operations and enhancing UX strategy. <br><br>
      
  In Fall 2022, I worked as a Quantitative Human-Computer Interaction Research Intern at <a href="https://motional.com/" target="_blank">Motional</a>, conducting 
  mixed-methods research, leveraging Python and R to analyze user cognition and optimize KPIs for AV usability and trust.<br><br>
      
  From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a Research Engineer Co-op at <a href="https://www.adusa.com/" target="_blank">Ahold Delhaize USA</a>, conducting qualitative research 
  with grocery store stakeholders to identify pain points in automation adoption. <br><br>
      
  Prior to my PhD, I researched shared autonomy and adaptive human-machine systems under <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/jrheee-jamison-heard" 
  target="_blank">Dr. Jamison Heard</a> at Rochester Institute of Technology, developing fuzzy-logic-based controllers for workload-adaptive automation. <br><br> 
      
  I have contributed to human-centered design in automation across academia and industry, focusing on trust, transparency, and usability in intelligent systems.

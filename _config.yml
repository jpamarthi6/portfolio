      Iâ€™m an engineer turned Human Factors Researcher with 5 years of experience across startups, robotics, and the automotive industry.<br><br>
      
      With a background in electrical engineering and a focus on human-robot interaction, I design intelligent systems that reflect real-world needs, especially for communities often left out of tech design. 
      My work bridges data, design, and strategy to create seamless, intuitive, and trust-enhancing user experiences.<br><br>

# In Summer 2024, I worked as a UX Research Intern at <a href="https://torc.ai/" target="_blank">TORC Robotics</a>, leading stakeholder research, uncovering transparency 
# gaps, and optimizing UX workflows for AV development. My work led to five key process improvements, streamlining operations and enhancing UX strategy. <br><br>
